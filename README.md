# beergame
A text based beer game server and client. Just double click bg_server.py to fire up the server and the IP address will be printed for players and admin to log in. Distribute to players only the bg_client.py file, which is also started by double-clicking. Admin can also login to the server by double-clicking admin.py. Need Python 3 on both the server and the client end.
